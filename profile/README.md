## Welcome!

This is the Retro Redrawn github organization, where all the magic that holds up redrawn projects is put together.
If you want to participate you can check out the Kanto repository for a list of issues or check in at our discord; the invite link is available through our core website.

Retro Redrawn is administrated by @Foofarawr and its tech stack is managed and largely maintained by @vulture-boy.
